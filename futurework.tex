\section{Future Work}

\paragraph{Refiner}
Recent advances in the computer vision field such as [refer to apple article], tries to cope the approximations and limitations of simulations used to generate synthetic data sets. [Authors] shows that using Generative Methods that they can generate more realistic looking data from examples generated in a simulation. Such efforts can similarly be beneficial in this project, possibly adjusting shadows slightly to reflect a more realistic setting. 

\paragraph{Effective Grasp Labelling}
As of now the only to way to tell the gripper in the simulation how to grasp any object, is to actually label each individual grasp manually for each object. This is quite a daunting task and not very interesting from a machine learning perspective, much rather an automatic way of labelling or detecting possible valid grasp would be beneficial to reach has higher degree of generality of the gripper simulations and thereby also the generated data sets
